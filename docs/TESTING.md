# Testing Spec

### Guide Agent Unit Testing

To test the Guide Agent by itself, I edited the chatserver2.c client-server
communication so that the server could send messages back to the client, also
displaying any input gotten from the Guide Agent itself. This program is 
called server.c in the testing subdirectory.
