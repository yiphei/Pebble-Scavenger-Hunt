# KRAG Design
The KRAG game will be broken up into three components: Field Agent, Guide Agent, and Game Server, as well as a common library containing code used by all three.

## Field Agent
The Field Agent is a Pebble app that communicates with the Game Server and interacts with the player wearing the Pebble.
